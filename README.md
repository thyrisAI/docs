## Writing Requirements

Every doc needs a header. This is where you will put your metadata.

Example header:
```
---
title: "/api/text"
categories: ['docs']
status: "published"
---
```

After this, you can start writing your documentation. All files need to be `.MDX`. To learn how MDX formatting works, refer to https://mdxjs.com/
